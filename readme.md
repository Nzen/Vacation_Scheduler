### Usage ###

Activate the jar by double clicking or launching with java. Choose a year and a month. Put the person's name (short preferable), hiso'er seniority, and hiso'er level of choice for the next action. Ensure the radio buttons of add/delete match your current intent. Click a day to apply that action. Doing so may rearrange everyone if a level can('t) be satisfied thereafter.

Navigate around the year by choosing months from the drop down or with the earlier/later buttons. Save will write the entered information as a binary file called people.ser (the ui too). Restore will try to hoist that data back into the calendar.
